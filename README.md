# Gaussian-fPEPS

Translate the projected BCS state to the fermionic projected entangled pair state(fPEPS).

# About

Demo code for the paper [Projected d-wave superconducting state: a fermionic projected entangled pair state study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04566).


# Example

Using [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) Notebook and open example.jl

# Install

## Python dependencies:

[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), [PyManopt](https://pymanopt.org/) and [h5py](https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/) are required to run gfpeps/main.py.

## Julia dependencies:

[Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) is needed to open the example notebook.
